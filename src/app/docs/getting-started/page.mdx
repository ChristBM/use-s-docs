# Getting Started

Welcome to `use-s-react`!
This guide will walk you through installing the library and using it for both **local** and **global** state management — all with the simplicity of `useState`.

---

## 📦 Installation

Install via npm (or your preferred package manager):

```bash copy
npm i use-s-react
```

---

## 🔍 Importing the Hook

Start by importing the hook into your component:

```ts copy
import { useS } from "use-s-react";
```

---

## ⚡ Using Local State

Using `useS` for local state feels just like `useState` — but with more power under the hood:

```tsx showLineNumbers filename="LocalCounter.tsx" copy /useS/
import { useS } from "use-s-react";

export default function LocalCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useS(0);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)}>
      You clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
}
```

---

## 🌍 Using Global State (The Easy Way)

Want to share state across components?
Just pass a unique `key` along with your `value`. All components using the same `key` will share the same state.

```tsx showLineNumbers filename="GlobalCounter.tsx" copy /key/ /value/
import { useS } from "use-s-react";

export default function GlobalCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useS({ value: 0, key: "global-counter" });

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)}>
      You clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
}
```

Try this line in another component:

```tsx copy
const [count, setCount] = useS({ value: 0, key: "global-counter" });
```

You'll see both components stay perfectly in sync — **no context required**.

---

## 🎉 That’s It!

No context.
No providers.
No boilerplate.
Just powerful state in **one line**.
