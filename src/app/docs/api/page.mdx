# API Reference

The `useS` hook offers a powerful yet minimal API to manage both **local** and **global** state in React ‚Äî with built-in immutability and TypeScript support.

---

## üß† `useS(initialValue: T)`

Creates a **local** state, just like `useState`, but with enhanced capabilities:

```ts copy /useS/ /number/ /initialValue/
const [state, setState] = useS(0);
```

- State type is automatically inferred from the `initialValue`.
- Supports primitives, objects, arrays, `Map`, `Set`, `Date`, `RegExp`, and more.
- Automatically applies immutability under the hood.

---

## üåç `useS({ value: T, key: string })`

Creates a **global** state shared across all components using the same `key`.

```ts copy /value/ /key/
const [count, setCount] = useS({
  value: 0,
  key: "global-counter",
});
```

This is functionally identical to local state, but allows cross-component sharing.

### üîë Global State Rules

- `key` must be a **non-empty unique string**.
- The **first call** to `useS()` with a given key sets the **initial value**.
- All subsequent calls with the same key:
  - Share the **same state**.
  - **Ignore** the `value` parameter.
- This ensures state consistency without conflicts or duplication ‚Äî regardless of where or how many times the key is used.

---

## üß¨ Built-In Immutability

`useS` performs deep, optimized cloning so you can update nested state safely and declaratively ‚Äî no need to mutate or manually deep merge.

```ts copy /count/
const initialValue = {
  game: "Call Of useS",
  info: {
    count: 0,
    points: [2, 6, 3, 4],
  },
  players: 10,
};
```

Update with direct override:

```ts copy /count/
setGameStats({ info: { count: 0 } });
```

Or with a functional update:

```ts copy /prev/
setGameStats((prev) => ({
  info: {
    count: prev.info.count + 1,
  },
}));
```

---

## ‚úÖ Supported Value Types

You can store and update the following safely:

- Primitives: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`
- Arrays
- Plain objects (deep merge supported)
- Complex types: `Map`, `Set`, `Date`, `RegExp`
- **Functions** as object properties (they are preserved)

---

## üîç Intelligent Comparison and Render Prevention

One of the most powerful optimizations in `useS` is its ability to **prevent unnecessary re-renders** through structural comparison between the previous and the next value.  
This means that if the value hasn‚Äôt changed in a meaningful way, the state won't update and the component won‚Äôt re-render.

### How Does It Work?

Internally, `useS` uses a comparison function based on the data type.
Each supported type has its own mechanism to determine whether a change has occurred:

| Value Type         | Comparison Strategy                                            |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Primitives         | `Object.is(a, b)`                                              |
| `Date`             | Compares timestamps using `getTime()`                          |
| `RegExp`           | Compares `source` and `flags`                                  |
| `Set`              | Compares size and checks all elements are present              |
| `Map`              | Compares size and each `key/value` pair                        |
| `Array`            | Shallow comparison using `array.every(Object.is)`              |
| `Object`           | Recursive comparison of keys and values, including nested ones |

This allows you to handle complex structures without external tools or manual hacks like `JSON.stringify`.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Exception: Functions

Although you can include functions as part of your state (e.g., components, methods, or getters), these are **not compared**.   Every time a key with a function value is updated (even if it's the same reference), it is treated as a change, which will **trigger a state update and a re-render**.

This behavior is consistent with how React handles functions and may be optimized in future versions.
