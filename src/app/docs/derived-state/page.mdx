# Derived State

## üß† A Common Technique We All Use

You've probably had to compute one piece of state from another ‚Äî that's **derived state**.

Most state libraries introduce abstractions or custom logic for this.
`useS` does not.

It lets you use the **JavaScript you already know**.
No special syntax. No new mental models. Just state and logic.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Using Functions as State Properties

You can define functions as part of your state object:

```tsx showLineNumbers filename="Component.tsx" copy /total/ /thanks/
import { useS } from "use-s-react";

type CartType = {
  cart: number[];
  total: (cart: number[]) => number;
  thanks: (total: number) => string;
};

const initialValue: CartType = {
  cart: [1, 2, 3, 4],
  total: function (cart: number[]) {
    return cart.reduce((sum: number, item: number) => sum + item, 0);
  },
  thanks: function (total: number) {
    return `Thanks for your purchase of: ${total}`;
  },
};

export default function Component() {
  const [{ cart, total, thanks }, setState] = useS(initialValue);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Total: {total(cart)}</h1>
      <h3>{thanks(total(cart))}</h3>

      <ul>
        <p>cart:</p>
        {cart.map((i, index) => (
          <li key={i + index + "key"}>{i}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <button
        onClick={() =>
          setState((prev) => ({ cart: [...prev.cart, prev.cart.length + 1] }))
        }
      >
        + 1 Price
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### üß© How It Works

- `total` is a function that derives value from `cart`
- `thanks` is a function that uses the result of `total`
- React automatically re-renders when state changes, and the functions respond accordingly

This is **derived state**, the `useS` way:
No `useEffect`, no custom hooks, no `useMemo`. Just logic.

## üß™ Updating Function Keys

Yes ‚Äî you can also **update** function properties in your state:

```tsx showLineNumbers filename="Component.tsx" copy /thanks/
import { useS } from "use-s-react";

type CartType = { ... };

const initialValue: CartType = { ... };

export default function Component() {
  const [{ cart, total, thanks }, setState] = useS(initialValue);

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>{thanks(total(cart))}</h3>

      <button
        onClick={() =>
          setState(() => ({
            thanks: function (total: number) {
              return `Thank you, but you should spend more than: ${total} :)`;
            },
          }))
        }
      >
        Say spend more
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This example updates the `thanks` function dynamically ‚Äî something most libraries don‚Äôt support out of the box.

## üåç Global Derived State

If you need this logic across components, simply place the initial value in your [Global Store](/docs/global-store) and reuse it anywhere via:

```tsx
const [state] = useS(store.globalCart);
```

---

With `useS`, derived logic stays **close to your data**, and everything stays **declarative and scalable**.
