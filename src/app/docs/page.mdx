# Why `useS`?

## Simplifying State Management in React

I created `use-s-react` with a clear goal: to make state management in React **easier**, **cleaner**, and **more powerful**.

Most state management libraries today ask too much: new concepts to learn, boilerplate to write, and setup code that bloats your project. Even React's built-in tools like `useState`, `useReducer`, and context don't offer a complete solution thatâ€™s both simple and scalable.

So I asked myself:

> What if there were a hook as easy to use as `useState`, but with superpowers?

## What's Broken with the Current Approach?

### 1. Sharing Global State is Overcomplicated

To share state across components, you're usually stuck doing this:

- Create a context using `createContext`
- Define and export a Provider
- Wrap your app or component tree with the Provider
- Use `useContext` in each component
- Optionally write custom hooks to abstract logic

This isn't just verboseâ€”it also introduces re-render traps and scalability headaches.

### 2. `useState` Doesnâ€™t Scale for Real-World Needs

`useState` is great for simple valuesâ€”but not for:

- Complex data (e.g., deeply nested objects)
- Built-in immutability
- Declarative derived state

If you reach for `useReducer`, now you're:

- Learning a new paradigm
- Writing action types and reducer functions
- Manually handling immutability
- Sacrificing simplicity for flexibility

## The Answer: `useS`

`useS` was built to offer the best of both worlds:

- âœ… API as intuitive as `useState`
- âœ… Manage **local and global** state with one line
- âœ… No context, providers, or boilerplate
- âœ… Immutable by defaultâ€”even for complex objects
- âœ… Support for declarative derived state
- âœ… Full TypeScript support
- âœ… Powered by `useSyncExternalStore` for consistency and performance

## Why `useSyncExternalStore`?

React 18 introduced `useSyncExternalStore` to provide safe, efficient subscriptions to external stores. It became the perfect foundation for `useS`, delivering:

- **Automatic reactivity** that integrates naturally with Reactâ€™s lifecycle
- **Scalability** without relying on third-party libraries
- **Flexibility** to define local or global state based on your needs

## A Dev-Friendly Hook Without the Overhead

After working with nearly every popular state library, I realized none of them nailed the balance between **simplicity** and **power**. So I built one:

> Powerful enough for professionals, simple enough for everyone.

## ðŸš€ Give It a Try

Tired of boilerplate, context, and configuration hell?
Give `useS` a spinâ€”you might never look back.

And if you find it useful, share it with your team or the community.
Letâ€™s make React state management **simple again**.
